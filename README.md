This code produces a PPM format image using a basic raytracer. 
Spheres of materials/surfaces of lambertian, metal, or dielectric (glass) can be placed within the scene and reflect or refract light rays based on where they are placed relative to the camera.
Additionally, sharper images can be produced when the samples per pixel is increased, however, it will take a considerably longer time to render.
